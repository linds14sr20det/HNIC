###HNIC CMS###
This is the cms/blog for the Hobby Night in Canada Podcast. It is based around October CMS and the Minify theme. Both have been moderately reworked to fit our visual styles.

###Notable Changes###
The Minify Theme has been heavilly reworked. Do not update it with the newer minify (obviously).

As well, the rainlab blog plugin has been reworked. The Post.php controller has been modified to pass in the required next and previous post. As well, the posts/default.htm and post/default.htm have been heavilly modified to fit our theme and to hold data elements to enable swipe navigation. Rainlab blog plugin upgrades are doable, just be careful.
